This folder contains some scripts to automate setting up and testing Holberton's HBnB V4 project.

To begin, SSH into the following sandbox: Ubuntu 16.04 - Python 3.5 / Fabric / Puppet

Destroy it and recreate it if you've used it before.

Run the script by executing the following:

`sudo su -c "bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magicaldave/hBnB_Init/main/sandy-init.sh)"`

Enter the username of the person who owns your AirBnB_v4 repository.

Take a snack break.

When the script has finished, it'll ask which project you wish to run.
Acceptable values are within 0-4.

You can CTRL-C to close the flask application and run `sandy-run.sh` to open the flask application again for a new file.
